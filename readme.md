# Speaker Splitter

A Python tool to separate audio files by speaker using diarization data. This tool takes a WAV audio file and a JSON file containing speaker timestamps, and creates individual WAV files for each speaker, maintaining the original timing and replacing other speakers' segments with silence.

## Features

- Separates multi-speaker audio into individual speaker files
- Preserves original timing and audio quality
- Handles timestamps in HH:MM:SS,MMM format
- Creates silence during non-speaking segments
- Supports multiple speakers
- Simple command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pydub` library for audio processing
- FFmpeg (required by pydub)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmaudet/audio-speaker-separator.git
cd audio-speaker-separator
```

2. Create and activate a Conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n audio-splitter python=3.11
conda activate audio-splitter
```

3. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:
```bash
pip install pydub gradio
```

4. Install FFmpeg:
- Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  ```
- macOS:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

## Usage

### Option 1: Web UI (Recommended for Easy Use)

Launch the Gradio web interface for a user-friendly experience:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a web server and open a browser window where you can:
1. Upload your WAV audio file
2. Upload your JSON diarization file
3. Click "Split Speakers"
4. Download the individual speaker files

The web UI provides real-time status updates and easy file management.

### Option 2: Command Line Interface

The basic command format is:
```bash
python speaker_splitter.py input.wav diarization.json
```

### Input Files

1. Audio file (`input.wav`):
   - Must be in WAV format
   - Contains the multi-speaker audio to be separated

2. JSON file (`diarization.json`):
   - Contains speaker segments with timestamps
   - Can be generated using various diarization tools such as:
     - [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX): an open-source tool that combines Whisper with speaker diarization
     - [LinTO](https://linto.app): an enterprise-grade conversational AI platform developed by [LINAGORA](https://www.linagora.com)
   - Format example:
```json
{
  "segments": [
    {
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
      "start": "00:01:57,000",
      "end": "00:01:59,000",
      "text": "Example text"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_01",
      "start": "00:02:14,000",
      "end": "00:02:20,000",
      "text": "Another example"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Generating the JSON File

1. Using WhisperX:
```bash
# Install WhisperX
pip install whisperx

# Run diarization
whisperx audio.wav --diarize
```

2. Using LinTO:
   - Visit [LinTO Platform](https://linto.app)
   - Upload your audio file
   - Use the transcription and diarization service
   - Export the results in JSON format

Both tools provide accurate speaker diarization and transcription, with the JSON output being compatible with this tool.

### Output

The script generates separate WAV files for each speaker:
- `output-audio-SPEAKER_00.wav`
- `output-audio-SPEAKER_01.wav`
- etc.

Each output file:
- Has the same duration as the input file
- Contains only the specified speaker's segments
- Contains silence during other speakers' segments
- Maintains original timing and audio quality

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for common issues:
- Invalid input files
- Incorrect JSON format
- Missing audio file
- Invalid timestamps
- Python version verification

## Future Developments (not planned yet)
- WhisperX Integration: a major planned enhancement is the direct integration of WhisperX for a complete transcription and diarization workflow
- Audio Format Support: add support for additional audio formats such as MP3, FLAC, etc.
- Cross-fade between segments to reduce abrupt transitions
- âœ… ~~Simple web interface for file upload and processing and real-time processing status~~ **DONE - Gradio UI available!**
- Speech overlap detection and handling
- Process multiple files in batch
- Docker container for easy deployment
- Integration with LinTO platform
